## Reflections and Comments

I strive to keep my learning process in check by evaluating outcomes and also discerning the right input, which is crucial in a world of information explosion. I will gauge my ability to apply the topic at hand to the real world and build on it using stacked modules. Having so much to learn in the real world, I try to evaluate what I want to learn every two weeks.
